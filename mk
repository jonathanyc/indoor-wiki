(* mk: a fanny pack for OCaml projects.
   Disorganized and unstlyish, but handy.

   Provides shortcuts for common tasks involving OCaml projects, e.g.:
   - installing a project as a library
   - writing the same list of dependencies to .merlin, _tags, and META
   - running _test.ml files

   It's intended that you copy this script to your project's directory and
   modify it however you see fit. It's called mk because it's easy to type
   "./mk" with one hand.

   You're expected to have a directory structure like this:

       project/
         mk
         src/
           main.ml
           some_module.ml
           some_module_test.ml
           ...

    -quiet flag is given to ocamlbuild, which causes normal output to be
    suppressed (only errors are output). The main point is that it includes the
    -use-ocamlfind flag which we need for pretty much everything. *)

    parent directory, the root of the repository. *)

    current directory, separated by newlines, to [dest]. We use it to create
    the .mllib, .odocl, and .mltop files that ocamlbuild wants, including all
    of the modules in the project. Modules named in [excludes] are excluded,

(** [splice_file path tag s] splices the autogenerated text [s] into the file
    at [path]. If no file exists then a new one is created containing [s]. If
    one already exist that doesn't contain a splice section tagged [tag] then
    [s] is spliced at the end of the file. Otherwise the existing splice
    section is replaced with [s]. A splice section looks like:
    
        #begin mk TAG
        S
